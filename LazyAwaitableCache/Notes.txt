Test behaviour under load
Test AutoResetOnExceptionFeature.

Features:
Reload cache in background, before expiration (refresh cache periodically)
Enable AwaitCacheItemStrategy to configure Await with continueOnCapturedContext flag (maybe as parameter in ctor)

Decisions:
ContinueOnCapturedContext is a global setting that is set only once.

Problems:
OnItemAdd is also fired when GetOrCreateItem is invoked with an already existing key
So that the already existing item is returned.

Done:
Event ItemAdd is maybe (i'm more sure than not) not fired asynchronously -> fixed
